# Look

This week saw the completion of a third Telescope theme for [Scopemount](http://scopemount.surge.sh/). Galileo is a modern Q&A theme, taking some functional and visual cues from Quora and Medium.

The theme ships with a colourful sunburst gradient on the side-nav.

However, if you opt to install the package locally, you can edit the "_colors.less" file and switch to a cool aquamarine variant by uncommenting the corresponding code.

Out-of-the box Galileo includes 3 Google webfonts, which are mostly for showcasing purposes. The font "Yesteryear" is only used on the logo. If you are concerned with page load times, feel free to throw out one or more of the webfonts and use standard native fonts by editing "_typography.less".

# Install

You can install Galileo automagically through [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/montecruiseto/telescope-theme-sm-galileo):

```bash
$ meteor add montecruiseto:telescope-theme-sm-galileo
```

Alternatively if you want to customize the theme: [Download](https://github.com/montecruiseto/scopemount) and extract the theme of your choice to your Telescope package directory and run the same command as above. Telescope will look for the local package first and use that one.

***Note:*** *Remember to set Telescope to 'side' navigation and post 'list' mode in your admin settings.*

# Galileo

This theme was named after the [Telescopio Nazionale Galileo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescopio_Nazionale_Galileo), a 3.58m Italian telescope located on the island of San Miguel de La Palma (or, more simply, La Palma), in the Canary Islands archipelago.
