Glad to announce the fifth [Scopemount](http://scopemount.startrack.io/) theme for [Telescope](http://www.telescopeapp.org/), the open-source Meteor-based web app that makes it easy for anybody to launch their own community.

## Quick Links

[Demo](http://sm-sloan.meteor.com/)

## Look

Sloan is a very simple theme that can be useful for communities that crowd-curate digital products. This minimalistic and focused design is a port of the [Gulp plugin page](http://gulpjs.com/plugins/) design to Telescope.

## Install

You can install Sloan automagically through [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/montecruiseto/telescope-theme-sm-sloan):

```bash
$ meteor add montecruiseto:telescope-theme-sm-sloan
```

Alternatively if you want to customize the theme: [Download](https://github.com/montecruiseto/scopemount) and extract the theme of your choice to your Telescope package directory and run the same command as above. Telescope will look for the local package first and use that one.

## Palomar

This theme was named after the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloan_Digital_Sky_Survey), a 2.5-m wide-angle optical telescope at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, United States.

If you want to be notified of theme updates or new releases, you can leave your email on the [Scopemount](http://scopemount.startrack.io/) homepage. Have fun with Telescope and don't take your eyes off the sky!
