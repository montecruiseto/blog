*Update May 23 2015: Gemini is now refactored to run on Telescope v0.20.4.*

Gemini is the first Telescope theme for [Scopemount](http://scopemount.startrack.io/).

## Look

Gemini is a modern music theme, inspired by sites like [Atlantic Records](http://www.atlanticrecords.com/) and [Stoney Roads](http://stoneyroads.com/). You can click here for a [demo](http://sm-gemini.meteor.com/).

## Usage

You can install Gemini automagically through [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/montecruiseto/telescope-theme-sm-gemini):

```bash
$ meteor add montecruiseto:telescope-theme-sm-gemini
```

Alternatively if you want to customize the theme: [Download](https://github.com/montecruiseto/scopemount) and extract the theme of your choice to your Telescope package directory and run the same command as above. Telescope will look for the local package first and use that one.

## Gemini

This theme was named after the [Gemini Observatory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_Observatory), located at over 2,700 metres (8,900 ft) elevation on a mountain in the Chilean Andes called Cerro Pachón.
