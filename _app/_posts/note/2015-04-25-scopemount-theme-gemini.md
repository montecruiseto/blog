# Look

Gemini is the first Telescope theme for [Scopemount](http://scopemount.surge.sh). It's a modern music theme, inspired by sites like [Atlantic Records](http://www.atlanticrecords.com/) and [Stoney Roads](http://stoneyroads.com/).

# Install

***Note:*** *Set your Telescope admin settings to post 'list' mode and include Embedly thumbs with a width of 350px and height of 350px.*

You can install Gemini automagically through [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/montecruiseto/telescope-theme-sm-gemini):

```bash
$ meteor add montecruiseto:telescope-theme-sm-gemini
```

Alternatively if you want to customize the theme: [Download](https://github.com/montecruiseto/scopemount) and extract the theme of your choice to your Telescope package directory and run the same command as above. Telescope will look for the local package first and use that one.

# Gemini

This theme was named after the [Gemini Observatory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_Observatory), located at over 2,700 metres (8,900 ft) elevation on a mountain in the Chilean Andes called Cerro Pachón.
