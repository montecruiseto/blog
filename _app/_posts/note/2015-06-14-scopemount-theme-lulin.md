## Install

***Note:*** *Set your Telescope admin settings to post 'grid' mode and include Embedly thumbs with a width of 700px and height of 350px.*

You can install Lulin automagically through [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/montecruiseto/telescope-theme-sm-lulin):

```bash
$ meteor add montecruiseto:telescope-theme-sm-lulin
```

Alternatively if you want to customize the theme: [Download](https://github.com/montecruiseto/scopemount) and extract the theme of your choice to your Telescope package directory and run the same command as above. Telescope will look for the local package first and use that one.

## Lulin

This theme was named after the [Lulin Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lulin_Observatory), an astronomical observatory operated by the Institute of Astronomy, National Central University in Taiwan. It is located at the summit of Mount Lulin, near Yushan National Park.
