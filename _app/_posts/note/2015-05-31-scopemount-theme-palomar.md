*Update June 11 2015: Palomar is now refactored to run on Telescope v0.20.5*

The fourth [Scopemount](http://scopemount.startrack.io/) theme for Telescope is out today. [Telescope](http://www.telescopeapp.org/) is an open-source Meteor-based web app that makes it easy for anybody to launch their own community. Go check it out!

## Look

Palomar is a theme that's great for a travel or photography community, putting an emphasis on large imagery. As usual, a lot of creative borrowing has been done. This time from the likes of [TripExpert](http://www.tripexpert.com) and [Jelly app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jelly/id685652528?mt=8).

Mobile views have miniature cards, and care has been taken to provide admins with the necessary stats in a compact layout.

## Install

***Note:*** *Remember to set your Telescope admin settings to post 'grid' mode and include Embedly thumbs with a width of 700px and height of 350px.*

You can install Palomar automagically through [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/montecruiseto/telescope-theme-sm-palomar):

```bash
$ meteor add montecruiseto:telescope-theme-sm-palomar
```

Alternatively if you want to customize the theme: [Download](https://github.com/montecruiseto/scopemount) and extract the theme of your choice to your Telescope package directory and run the same command as above. Telescope will look for the local package first and use that one.

## Palomar

This theme was named after the [Palomar Observatory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palomar_Observatory), built in 1928 and located in San Diego County, California, US, in the Palomar Mountain Range.
