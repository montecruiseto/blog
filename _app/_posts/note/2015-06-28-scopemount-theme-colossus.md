# Look

Colossus, the eight [Scopemount](http://scopemount.surge.sh/) theme for Telescope, is perfect for that big and bold boutique look. It came about as a mashup between modern designs such as [Designmodo Market](http://market.designmodo.com/baikal/) and [Apple](https://www.apple.com/ios/).

Colossus is the first Scopemount theme not to be dependent on the Hubble theme, hence the more "out-of-the-box" look.
Credits go again to [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/02/26/inspiration-button-styles-effects/) for the CSS3 button effects.

# Install

***Note:*** *Set your Telescope admin settings to post 'list' mode and include Embedly thumbs with a width of 580px and height of 328px.*

You can install Colossus automagically through [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/montecruiseto/telescope-theme-sm-colossus):

```bash
$ meteor add montecruiseto:telescope-theme-sm-colossus
```

Alternatively if you want to customize the theme: [Download](https://github.com/montecruiseto/scopemount) and extract the theme folder to your Telescope package directory and run the same command as above. Telescope will look for the local package first and use that one.

# Colossus

This theme was named after the [Colossus Telescope](http://the-colossus.com/events.html). Proposed in 2014, the Colossus Telescope is planned to be the world's largest optical and infrared telescope optimized for detecting extrasolar life and extraterrestrial civilizations.
