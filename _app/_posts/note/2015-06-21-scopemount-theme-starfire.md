# Look
A new week, a new [Scopemount](http://scopemount.surge.sh) theme for Telescope. Starfire gives you a base to create your very own gaming news site in no time. Go head-on with sites like [Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/), [Metro](http://metro.co.uk/entertainment/gaming/) and [GamesRadar](http://www.gamesradar.com/news/) today! Just install & deploy.

The theme makes use of the gooey button effect recently created by the talented [Lucas Bebber](https://css-tricks.com/gooey-effect/). The buttons work by cleverly combining CSS3 transforms and transitions with a sophisticated svg filter underneath.

***Note:*** *Although the gooey buttons work perfectly in Google chrome, I have found them to render inconsistently on Safari. If anyone can solve that bug then you'll be doing humanity a great favour. Until then, I would suggest to exclude the svg filter and retain only the CSS3 animation in your production app.*

# Install

***Note:*** *Set your Telescope admin settings to post 'grid' mode and include Embedly thumbs with a width of 340px and height of 192px.*

You can install Starfire automagically through [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/montecruiseto/telescope-theme-sm-starfire):

```

Alternatively if you want to customize the theme: [Download](https://github.com/montecruiseto/scopemount) and extract the theme folder to your Telescope package directory and run the same command as above. Telescope will look for the local package first and use that one.

***Note:*** *The font "Voltaire" is only used on the logo. If you are concerned with page load times, feel free to throw out one or more of the webfonts and use standard native fonts by editing "_typography.less".*

# Starfire

This theme was named after the [Starfire Optical Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfire_Optical_Range), a United States Air Force research laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Its has a 3.5 meter telescope which is "one of the largest telescopes in the world equipped with adaptive optics designed for satellite tracking".
