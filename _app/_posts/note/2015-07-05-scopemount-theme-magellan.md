# Look

Turn your Telescope app into a blog with Magellan, [Scopemount](http://scopemount.startrack.io/) theme number nine. This particular theme was heavily inspired by the [TechInAsia](https://www.techinasia.com/)-blog design.

# Install

***Note:*** *Set your Telescope admin settings to post 'list' mode and include Embedly thumbs with a width of 200px and height of 112px.*

You can install Magellan automagically through [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/montecruiseto/telescope-theme-sm-magellan):

```bash
$ meteor add montecruiseto:telescope-theme-sm-magellan
```

Alternatively if you want to customize the theme: [Download](https://github.com/montecruiseto/scopemount) and extract the theme folder to your Telescope package directory and run the same command as above. Telescope will look for the local package first and use that one.

# Magellan

This theme was named after the [Giant Magellan Telescope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Magellan_Telescope), a ground-based extremely large telescope in Chile, planned for completion in 2025. The telescope is expected to have over five to ten times the light-gathering ability of existing ones.
