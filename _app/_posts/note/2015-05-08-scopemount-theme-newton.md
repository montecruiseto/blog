*Update May 23 2015: Newton is now refactored to run on Telescope v0.20.4.*

Newton is the second Telescope theme for [Scopemount](http://scopemount.startrack.io/).

## Look

Newton is a minimal tech news theme taking some inspiration from sites like Designer News and Hacker News. You can click here for a [demo](http://sm-newton.meteor.com/).

## Usage

You can install Newton automagically through [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/montecruiseto/telescope-theme-sm-newton):

```bash
$ meteor add montecruiseto:telescope-theme-sm-newton
```

Alternatively if you want to customize the theme: [Download](https://github.com/montecruiseto/scopemount) and extract the theme of your choice to your Telescope package directory and run the same command as above. Telescope will look for the local package first and use that one.

## Newton

This theme was named after [Newton's reflector](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_reflector). It was built by Sir Isaac Newton in 1668 and is a landmark in the history of telescopes, being the first known successful reflecting telescope.
